### Tips for Using Images in Flutter

- **Image Optimization**: Optimize images to reduce app load times and improve performance. Tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) can help compress images.
- **Image Sizing**: Use appropriately sized images based on screen size or context within your app.
- **Image Formats**: Flutter supports `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.svg` (with packages like `flutter_svg`), and more.

### Legal Considerations

- **License Check**: Always check the licensing terms, even on free websites, to ensure images can be used in commercial or personal projects.
- **Attribution**: Some free resources require attribution, so make sure to follow the guidelines when using images with such requirements.
