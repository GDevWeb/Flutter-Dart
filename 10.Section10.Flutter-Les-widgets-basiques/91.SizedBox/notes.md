## 91. SizedBox

The `SizedBox` widget in Flutter is a simple yet versatile widget that is used to create empty space or to give a fixed size to its child. It can be used to control the width, height, or both dimensions of a widget. `SizedBox` is especially useful for adding spacing or when a fixed-size widget is needed in layouts.

### Code Example

In this example, `SizedBox` is used to create space between two text widgets and to constrain the size of a button:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('SizedBox Example')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              const Text("Hello, Flutter!"),

              // Adding vertical space with SizedBox
              const SizedBox(height: 20),

              const Text("Using SizedBox for spacing"),

              // Constraining the size of a button using SizedBox
              const SizedBox(
                width: 200, // Fixed width
                height: 50, // Fixed height
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: null,
                  child: Text("Fixed Size Button"),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Explanation of SizedBox Properties

- **`width`**: Sets a fixed width for the `SizedBox`. If no width is provided, it defaults to `0`.
- **`height`**: Sets a fixed height for the `SizedBox`. If no height is provided, it defaults to `0`.
- **`child`**: An optional child widget. When a child is provided, `SizedBox` constrains the size of the child based on the specified `width` and `height`.

### Common Uses of SizedBox

- **Spacing**: Used to add horizontal or vertical space between widgets by setting only one of `width` or `height`.
- **Fixed Dimensions**: Useful for creating fixed-size buttons, icons, or other widgets.
- **Empty Box**: If no width, height, or child is provided, it acts as an empty box that takes no space.

### Benefits of Using SizedBox

- **Simplicity**: A straightforward way to add space or constrain sizes without complex layout code.
- **Flexibility**: Works well with both layouts that require fixed dimensions and dynamic layouts where only spacing is needed.
- **Efficiency**: Keeps the layout clean and organized by managing spacing and sizing explicitly.
